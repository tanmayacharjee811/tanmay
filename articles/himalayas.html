                My journey to the Himalayas began in the small town of Manali, where the air was crisp and the mountains loomed large in the distance. The trek to Hampta Pass was challenging but rewarding, with breathtaking views of snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys.

                Along the way, I met locals who shared stories of their lives in the mountains. Their warmth and hospitality made the experience even more memorable. The highlight of the trip was reaching the summit, where the panoramic view of the Himalayas left me speechless.
